# Formularity Data

This folder contains the data obtained (output) from the freely available Formula Assignment software - Formularity. Two input files were used to make these files: the list of masses of replicate nº 1 (sample 14) of the CAN grapevine variety obtained in negative mode - CAN (14, 15, 16).xlsx on the 'data' folder (not present in the repository) - or the example file provided by Formularity ('test_peaks.txt' file on the documents of 'Formularity_Program_0', when downloaded from the source below). To transform to "neutral" masses, the proton attachment option was chosen with no other adducts considered. The Formula tolerance, Formula score and DB mass limit parameters were chosen as indicated for each of the files. Other parameters were kept as the default. The files are:

- CAN_SP_1_800.csv - CAN file with parameters: S+P Formula score, 1 ppm, 800 limit database
- CAN_SP_05_800.csv - CAN file with parameters: S+P Formula score, 0.5 ppm, 800 limit database
- CAN_NSP_05_800.csv - CAN file with parameters: N+S+P Formula score, 0.5 ppm, 800 limit database
- CAN_NSP_1_800.csv - CAN file with parameters: N+S+P Formula score, 1 ppm, 800 limit database
- TESTP_SP_05_700.csv - Test peak file with parameters: S+P Formula score, 0.5 ppm, 700 limit database
- TESTP_NSP_1_800.csv - Test peak file with parameters: N+S+P Formula score, 1 ppm, 800 limit database
