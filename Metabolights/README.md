# Metabolights

This folder contains the 5 datasets analysed in the 3 MetaboLights notebooks (BinSim_ML_Bluebells.ipynb, BinSim_ML_FC.ipynb, BinSim_ML_Wolbachia.ipynb). These datasets are in different formats (.xlsx or .tsv) that are read in their specific notebooks. Further characterization of each dataset is also made in each specific notebook.

#### For BinSim_ML_Bluebells.ipynb - Bluebell saponins: Application of metabolomics and molecular networking

- m_bluebells_metabolite_profiling_mass_spectrometry_v2_maf.tsv - Reverse Phase Liquid Chromatography (RPLC) â€“ High-Resolution Fourier Transform (Orbitrap) Mass Spectrometry

Five different tissues of the bluebells plant with different amounts of replicates (unbalanced dataset): Bulb (15 samples), Leaves (6 samples), Scapes (8 samples), Shoot (4 samples) and Flower (8 samples).

#### For BinSim_ML_FC.ipynb - Flow Cytometry Has a Significant Impact on the Cellular Metabolome

- m_mtbls629_NEG_mass_spectrometry_v2_maf.tsv - RPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS
- m_mtbls629_POS_mass_spectrometry_v2_maf.tsv - RPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS

Four groups of thioglycollate-induced peritoneal macrohpages with five biological replicates each (n = 20): Ctrl (peritoneal lavage pelleted cells immediately snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen upon isolation); Ab - Antibody (peritoneal macrophages subjected to immunostaining and subsequently stored in liquid N2 without sorting); Sort (freshly isolated macrophages immediately analyzed by flow cytometry without ab labeling and with sorting of the complete cell pop. into the collection tube); and Ab+Sort (freshly isolated cells immunostained and then sorted by flow cytometry, with collection of the complete cell population).

#### For BinSim_ML_Wolbachia.ipynb - Wolbachia Modulates Lipid Metabolism in Aedes albopictus Mosquito Cells

- DIMS_SFPM.xlsx - (Negative mode) Direct-infusion (DI) FT-ICR MS based Dataset (26 samples belonging to 4 different groups).
- LCMS_SFPM.xlsx - (Negative mode) RPLC FT-ICR MS based Dataset (28 samples belonging to 4 different groups, 2 were left out to compare with DIMS_SFPM.xlsx)

Each dataset has four groups including a quality control and 3 groups of Aedes albopictus Aa23 cells with different amount of replicates (slightly unbalanced data): QC - Quality Control (7 samples - LCMS_SFPM.xlsx has 9, but to compare with DIMS_SFPM.xlsx sample 8 and 9 were left out); L_A/LA - Aedes albopictus Aa23 cells with no infection (7 samples); L_AM/LAM - Aedes albopictus Aa23 cells infected with Mel (6 samples); and L_AP/LAP - Aedes albopictus Aa23 cells infected with MelPop (6 samples).
